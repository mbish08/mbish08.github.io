As I am finishing up on my Ruby-CLI project, I have spent some time reflecting on the last several weeks of starting this journey into software engineering.  Despite various technical issues and a hectic work schedule, I have made it this far and learned a ton along the way.  

I am not used to being in a position where I am not able to intuitively learn.  This module (and perhaps all of the software engineering track) was not an automatic learning process for me and put me very much out of my comfort zone (not a bad thing).  Reading the lessons was easy enough and it made sense.  Going to actually type out code was where I got stuck for the longest time.  Remembering syntax was quite a hang up (and still can be at times).  

Eventually, I realized that I was pushing myself a bit too hard and the expectations I placed on myself were too harsh.  At one point, I finally ended up just taking a day off from working thru lessons and labs.  I was in the middle of a lab and just couldn't make anything work.  When I went back to it after a day away, I was able to just work thru the lab like I felt like I should be able to do and get a whole bunch of other lessons and labs done all in one sitting.  

A check in with my educational coach and being able to talk thru this was like a light bulb moment and I realized that my own expectations were basically just turning my brain off from the overload.  I am now trying to be more mindful and when I get really stuck, I research and try some more.  When I hit the point of frustration, it's time to just walk away for a while (usually until the next day, but sometimes just a quick break is enough) and usually the solution just randomly pops into my head.  I email it to myself so I don't forget and then when I log in again, I have a good starting point and can usually complete what I was working on. 

Now, I just need to put the final pieces together on my project, record the walk through, and submit everything so I can get my review scheduled.  What a relief to get everything finished up without running super close to the deadline!
