As a kid, we had a Tandy 1000.  When we initially got it, we didn’t have any floppies to use, but it came with seemed like a giant book.  The book was filled with codes that we were able to input and have the computer do various things.  It took hours to input each set of codes just to have a simple animation display.  From there, I learned how to maneuver in DOS and to start writing some simple code to get results.  From that time on, I was fascinated with computers and what they could do.  

Later on, I went to an engineering summer camp where we explored the various types of engineering.  In one of our projects, we learned basic Java.  We then assembled robot vehicles and then used the codes we had written in Java to operate the vehicles.  

Life took various twists and turns.  The job that I had worked as a part-time season turned into a full-time seasonal.  I then added more positions with the same company.  One was as a field instructor and another as a QA Analyst for the online DIY product.  After a few years of software testing and working with the dev teams, I finally decided to make the jump and enroll in Flatiron’s Software Engineering bootcamp.
